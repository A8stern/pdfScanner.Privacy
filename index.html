            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This privacy policy is applicable to the PDF Scanner app (hereinafter referred to as "Application") for mobile devices, which was developed by Gleb Kovalev (hereinafter referred to as "Service Provider") as a Freemium service. This service is provided "AS IS".</p>

            <h2>What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?</h2>

            <h3>User Provided Information</h3>

However, bear in mind that you might not be able to utilize some of the features offered by the Application unless you register with them. The Service Provider may also use the information you provided them to contact you from time to time to provide you with important information, required notices, and marketing promotions.</p>

            <h3>Automatically Collected Information</h3>

The Service Provider may share your information with third parties in the ways that are described in this privacy statement.</p>
            <p>Please note that the Application utilizes third-party services that have their own Privacy Policy about handling data. Below are the links to the Privacy Policy of the third-party service providers used by the Application:</p>

They provide physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect information processed and maintained. While the Service Provider endeavors to provide reasonable security for information processed and maintained, no security system can prevent all potential security breaches.</p>
